        Pearson correlation of XCI skew between tissues.
        \textbf{a}, Correlation matrix of tissue-specific XCI skew. White boxes with 'X' symbol indicate that less than 25 observations were available for the tissue pair.
        \textbf{b}, Histogram of correlation between 1,017 non-identical tissue pairs. We observed a mean correlation of 0.3663 and median of 0.3992.
