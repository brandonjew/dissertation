  abstract = "CONTEXT: Adult height is highly heritable, yet no genetic
              predictor has demonstrated clinical utility compared to
              mid-parental height. OBJECTIVE: To develop a polygenic risk score
              for adult height and evaluate its clinical utility. DESIGN: A
              polygenic risk score was constructed based on meta-analysis of
              genome-wide association studies and evaluated on the Avon
              Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort.
              SUBJECTS: Participants included 442,599 genotyped White British
              individuals in the UK Biobank, and 941 genotyped child-parent
              trios of European ancestry in the ALSPAC cohort. INTERVENTIONS:
              None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standing height was measured using
              stadiometer; Standing height two standard deviations below the
              sex-specific population average was considered as short stature.
              RESULTS: Combined with sex, a polygenic risk score captured
              71.1\% of the total variance in adult height in the UK Biobank.
              In the ALSPAC cohort, the polygenic risk score was able to
              identify children who developed adulthood short stature with an
              area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of
              0.84, which is close to that of mid-parental height. Combining
              this polygenic risk score with mid-parental height, or only one
              of the child's parent's height, could improve the AUROC to at
              most 0.90. The polygenic risk score could also substitute
              mid-parental height in age-specific Khamis-Roche height
              predictors and achieve an equally strong discriminative power in
              identifying children with a short stature in adulthood.
              CONCLUSIONS: A polygenic risk score could be considered as an
              alternative or adjunct to mid-parental height to improve
              screening for children at risk of developing short stature in
              adulthood in European ancestry populations.",

              the penetrance of coding variants. Using functional genomic and
              genetic data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx),
              we observed that in the general population, purifying selection
              has depleted haplotype combinations predicted to increase
              pathogenic coding variant penetrance. Conversely, in cancer and
              autism patients, we observed an enrichment of penetrance
              increasing haplotype configurations for pathogenic variants in
              disease-implicated genes, providing evidence that regulatory
              haplotype configuration of coding variants affects disease risk.
              Finally, we experimentally validated this model by editing a

  abstract = "With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of
              multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become
              commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of
              features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null
              hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be
              significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical
              significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of
              the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance
              between the number of true and false positives that is
              automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a
              measure of statistical significance called the q value is
              associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to
              the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in
              terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive
              rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results,

              association tests based on standard linear regression are subject
              to reduced power and inflated type I error in finite samples.
              Applying the rank-based inverse normal transformation (INT) to
              nonnormally distributed traits has become common practice in
              GWAS. However, the different variations on INT-based association
              testing have not been formally defined, and guidance is lacking
              on when to use which approach. In this paper, we formally define
              and systematically compare the direct (D-INT) and indirect
              (I-INT) INT-based association tests. We discuss their
              assumptions, underlying generative models, and connections. We
              demonstrate that the relative powers of D-INT and I-INT depend on
              the underlying data generating process. Since neither approach is
              uniformly most powerful, we combine them into an adaptive omnibus
              test (O-INT). O-INT is robust to model misspecification, protects
              the type I error, and is well powered against a wide range of
              nonnormally distributed traits. Extensive simulations were
              conducted to examine the finite sample operating characteristics
              of these tests. Our results demonstrate that, for nonnormally
              distributed traits, INT-based tests outperform the standard
              untransformed association test, both in terms of power and type I
              error rate control. We apply the proposed methods to GWAS of

              highly penetrant contributors to severe Mendelian disorders. CADD
              is an integrative annotation built from more than 60 genomic

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) results in the
              silencing of most genes on one X chromosome, yielding
              mono-allelic expression in individual cells. However, random XCI
              results in expression of both alleles in most females. Allelic
              imbalances have been used genome-wide to detect mono-allelically
              expressed genes. Analysis of X-linked allelic imbalance in
              females with skewed XCI offers the opportunity to identify genes
              that escape XCI with bi-allelic expression in contrast to those
              with mono-allelic expression and which are therefore subject to
              XCI. RESULTS: We determine XCI status for 409 genes, all of which
              have at least five informative females in our dataset. The
              majority of genes are subject to XCI and genes that escape from
              XCI show a continuum of expression from the inactive X. Inactive
              X expression corresponds to differences in the level of histone
              modification detected by allelic imbalance after chromatin
              immunoprecipitation. Differences in XCI between populations and
              between cell lines derived from different tissues are observed.
              CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that allelic imbalance can be used to
              determine an inactivation status for X-linked genes, even without
              completely non-random XCI. There is a range of expression from
              the inactive X. Genes escaping XCI, including those that do so in
              only a subset of females, cluster together, demonstrating that
              XCI and location on the X chromosome are related. In addition to
              revealing mechanisms involved in cis-gene regulation, determining
              which genes escape XCI can expand our understanding of the

              variation, but the discovery of genetic interactions in humans
              has proved difficult. In this study, we show that the spectrum of

              of cis-regulatory variation on the functional impact of
              putatively deleterious protein-coding variants. We analyzed 1000
              Genomes population-scale resequencing data from Europe (CEU [Utah
              residents with Northern and Western European ancestry from the
              CEPH collection]) and Africa (YRI [Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria])
              together with gene expression data from arrays and RNA sequencing
              for the same samples. We observed an underrepresentation of
              derived putatively functional coding variation on the more highly
              expressed regulatory haplotype, which suggests stronger purifying
              selection against deleterious coding variants that have increased
              penetrance because of their regulatory background. Furthermore,
              the frequency spectrum and impact size distribution of common
              regulatory polymorphisms (eQTLs) appear to be shaped in order to
              minimize the selective disadvantage of having deleterious coding

              eQTLs explaining common disease GWAS signals showed an enrichment
              of putative epistatic effects, suggesting that some disease
              associations might arise from interactions increasing the

              indicate that regulatory and coding variants often modify the

              interaction is detectable from sequencing data in a genome-wide
              manner, and characterizing these joint effects might help us

              evaluation of human neoplasia is well-documented. However,
              excessive Lyonization is a potential limitation of these assays,
              because it mimics clonal derivation of cells. The incidence of
              excessive Lyonization in healthy females is controversial, with
              reported incidence varying from 4\% to 33\%. Several explanations
              have been offered for the observed variation, including different
              criteria for excessive Lyonization, diversity of X-linked
              clonality assays, small population sizes and more recently,
              tissue specificity of X-inactivation patterns. However, it is
              also possible that stem cell depletion, clonal hematopoiesis, or
              selection pressures on blood cells results in an increased
              incidence of excessive skewing. If any of the latter is true,
              then the incidence of excessive skewing should increase with age
              in blood cells. To test this hypothesis, we determined
              X-inactivation ratios at the human androgen receptor locus of 295
              normal females from three age groups: (1) neonates, (2) females
              28 to 32 years old and, (3) females aged > or = 60 years. The
              incidence of skewing (allele ratios > or = 3:1) was 8.6\% (14 of
              162) in neonates (P = .104 v 28 to 32); 16.4\% (11/67) in 28 to
              32 y.o. (P = .0064 v > or = 60), and 37.9\% (25 of 66) in women >
              or = 60 y.o. (P or = 10:1), the incidence was 1.9\% (3 of 162) in
              neonates (P = .362 v 28 to 32), 4.5\% (3 of 67) in 28 to 32 y.o.
              (P = .0022 v > or = 60), and 22.7\% (15 of 66) in > or = 60 y.o.
              group (P < .0001 v neonates). Results have been confirmed at the
              phosphoglycerate kinase locus for 48 heterozygous females. The
              incidence of excessive skewing increases with age. In neonates,
              the incidence is low and may correspond to true excessive
              Lyonization. Acquired skewing occurs with aging in normal females
              and is present in 38\% of females over the age of 60. Further
              studies are needed to determine whether acquired skewing is a
              consequence of stem cell depletion, true clonal hematopoiesis,
              growth advantage conferred by parental-specific X-chromosomes, or
              other causes. These data provide an explanation for variation in
              reported incidence of excessive skewing in normal females.
              Furthermore, these findings suggest that any study of clonality
              using X-inactivation based assays should incorporate age-matched
              controls for Lyonization.",

              Here, to identify genes, mutations and biological processes that
              give selective advantage to mutant clones, we analysed genotyping
              data from the blood-derived DNA of 482,789 participants from the

              alterations and analysed these for relationships to inherited
              genetic variation. We found 52 inherited, rare, large-effect
              coding or splice variants in 7 genes that were associated with
              greatly increased vulnerability to clonal haematopoiesis with
              specific acquired CN-LOH mutations. Acquired mutations

              division after DNA damage and telomere attrition; another two
              (MPL and SH2B3) encode proteins that regulate the self-renewal of
              stem cells. In addition, we found that CN-LOH mutations across
              the genome tended to cause chromosomal segments with alleles that
              promote the expansion of haematopoietic cells to replace their
              homologous (allelic) counterparts, increasing polygenic drive for
              blood-cell proliferation traits. Readily acquired mutations that
              replace chromosomal segments with their homologous counterparts

              expression dosage between XX females and XY males. XCI is,
              however, incomplete in humans: up to one-third of X-chromosomal
              genes are expressed from both the active and inactive X
              chromosomes (Xa and Xi, respectively) in female cells, with the
              degree of 'escape' from inactivation varying between genes and
              individuals. The extent to which XCI is shared between cells and
              tissues remains poorly characterized, as does the degree to which
              incomplete XCI manifests as detectable sex differences in gene
              expression and phenotypic traits. Here we describe a systematic
              survey of XCI, integrating over 5,500 transcriptomes from 449

              We show that XCI at 683 X-chromosomal genes is generally uniform
              across human tissues, but identify examples of heterogeneity
              between tissues, individuals and cells. We show that incomplete

  abstract = "SNPnexus is a web-based annotation tool for the analysis and
              interpretation of both known and novel sequencing variations.
              Since its last release, SNPnexus has received continual updates
              to expand the range and depth of annotations provided. SNPnexus
              has undergone a complete overhaul of the underlying
              infrastructure to accommodate faster computational times. The
              scope for data annotation has been substantially expanded to
              enhance biological interpretations of queried variants. This
              includes the addition of pathway analysis for the identification
              of enriched biological pathways and molecular processes. We have
              further expanded the range of user directed annotation fields
              available for the study of cancer sequencing data. These new
              additions facilitate investigations into cancer driver variants
              and targetable molecular alterations within input datasets. New
              user directed filtering options have been coupled with the
              addition of interactive graphical and visualization tools. These
              improvements streamline the analysis of variants derived from
              large sequencing datasets for the identification of biologically
              and clinically significant subsets in the data. SNPnexus is the
              most comprehensible web-based application currently available and
              these new set of updates ensures that it remains a
              state-of-the-art tool for researchers. SNPnexus is freely

  abstract = "X-inactivation is a well-established dosage compensation
              mechanism ensuring that X-chromosomal genes are expressed at
              comparable levels in males and females. Skewed X-inactivation is
              often explained by negative selection of one of the alleles. We
              demonstrate that imbalanced expression of the paternal and
              maternal X-chromosomes is common in the general population and
              that the random nature of the X-inactivation mechanism can be
              sufficient to explain the imbalance. To this end, we analyzed
              blood-derived RNA and whole-genome sequencing data from 79 female
              children and their parents from the Genome of the Netherlands
              project. We calculated the median ratio of the paternal over
              total counts at all X-chromosomal heterozygous single-nucleotide
              variants with coverage $\geq$10. We identified two individuals
              where the same X-chromosome was inactivated in all cells.
              Imbalanced expression of the two X-chromosomes (ratios $\leq$0.35
              or $\geq$0.65) was observed in nearly 50\% of the population. The
              empirically observed skewing is explained by a theoretical model
              where X-inactivation takes place in an embryonic stage in which
              eight cells give rise to the hematopoietic compartment. Genes
              escaping X-inactivation are expressed from both alleles and
              therefore demonstrate less skewing than inactivated genes. Using
              this characteristic, we identified three novel escapee genes
              (SSR4, REPS2, and SEPT6), but did not find support for many
              previously reported escapee genes in blood. Our collective data
              suggest that skewed X-inactivation is common in the general
              population. This may contribute to manifestation of symptoms in
              carriers of recessive X-linked disorders. We recommend that
              X-inactivation results should not be used lightly in the
              interpretation of X-linked variants.",

              sequencing on 67 T-ALLs to gain insight into the mutational
              spectrum in these leukemias. We detected protein-altering
              mutations in 508 genes, with an average of 8.2 mutations in
              pediatric and 21.0 mutations in adult T-ALL. Using stringent

              We identify CNOT3 as a tumor suppressor mutated in 7 of 89
              (7.9\%) adult T-ALLs, and its knockdown causes tumors in a
              sensitized Drosophila melanogaster model. In addition, we
              identify mutations affecting the ribosomal proteins RPL5 and

              multiple single-nucleotide-polymorphisms across the genome is
              used to assess such effects, and 'genomic control' can be applied
