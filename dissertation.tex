\acknowledgments {First and foremost, I thank my advisors, Eran Halperin and Jae Hoon Sul. I am extremely grateful to have both as amazing mentors through my growth as a computational researcher. They kept me engaged with amazing research and guidance over the past four years and I look forward to continuing this work.

I would also like to thank Eleazar Eskin, who roped me into bioinformatics in the first place and supported me through my PhD. Much of my work was done with Päivi Pajukanta, Noah Zaitlen, and Sriram Sankararaman. I thank these professors for great collaboration and mentorship. I thank Lana Martin and Robert Smith, who helped me immensely with funding and outreach projects during their time in Eleazar’s lab. I thank Sim-Lin Lau and Margaret Chu for their amazing support.

Many thanks to my lab mates in Eran's lab (Elior, Mike, Leah, Johnson, Liat, Ulzee, Brian, Nadav, Jeff) and Jae Hoon's Lab (Albert, Sarah, Lingyu). Also thanks to our shared lab space friends from Sriram's lab (Alec, Chris, Ruthie, Arun, Ariel, Ali). I really enjoyed talking too much during work hours and tracking down every opportunity for free food. 

Finally, I would like to thank my family for their unwavering support. I thank my wife, the amazing Dr. Maegan Lu. Over the past 8 years, we have grown so much together and I strive to keep up with her.
