  author   = "Robin, Xavier and Turck, Natacha and Hainard, Alexandre and
              Tiberti, Natalia and Lisacek, Fr{\'e}d{\'e}rique and Sanchez,
              Jean-Charles and M{\"u}ller, Markus",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are
              useful tools to evaluate classifiers in biomedical and
              bioinformatics applications. However, conclusions are often
              reached through inconsistent use or insufficient statistical
              analysis. To support researchers in their ROC curves analysis we
              developed pROC, a package for R and S+ that contains a set of
              tools displaying, analyzing, smoothing and comparing ROC curves
              in a user-friendly, object-oriented and flexible interface.
              RESULTS: With data previously imported into the R or S+
              environment, the pROC package builds ROC curves and includes
              functions for computing confidence intervals, statistical tests
              for comparing total or partial area under the curve or the
              operating points of different classifiers, and methods for
              smoothing ROC curves. Intermediary and final results are
              visualised in user-friendly interfaces. A case study based on
              published clinical and biomarker data shows how to perform a
              typical ROC analysis with pROC. CONCLUSIONS: pROC is a package
              for R and S+ specifically dedicated to ROC analysis. It proposes
              multiple statistical tests to compare ROC curves, and in
              particular partial areas under the curve, allowing proper ROC
              interpretation. pROC is available in two versions: in the R
              programming language or with a graphical user interface in the S+
              statistical software. It is accessible at
              http://expasy.org/tools/pROC/ under the GNU General Public
              License. It is also distributed through the CRAN and CSAN public

              data, examining 15,201 RNA-sequencing samples from 49 tissues of
              838 postmortem donors. We comprehensively characterize genetic
              associations for gene expression and splicing in cis and trans,
              showing that regulatory associations are found for almost all
              genes, and describe the underlying molecular mechanisms and their
              contribution to allelic heterogeneity and pleiotropy of complex
              traits. Leveraging the large diversity of tissues, we provide
              insights into the tissue specificity of genetic effects and show
              that cell type composition is a key factor in understanding gene
              regulatory mechanisms in human tissues.",

              residuals), a software package implementing statistical models
              that improve the sensitivity and interpretability of genetic
              associations in population-scale expression data. This approach
              builds on factor analysis methods that infer broad variance
              components in the measurements. PEER takes as input transcript
              profiles and covariates from a set of individuals, and then
              outputs hidden factors that explain much of the expression
              variability. Optionally, these factors can be interpreted as
              pathway or transcription factor activations by providing prior
              information about which genes are involved in the pathway or
              targeted by the factor. The inferred factors are used in genetic
              association analyses. First, they are treated as additional
              covariates, and are included in the model to increase detection
              power for mapping expression traits. Second, they are analyzed as
              phenotypes themselves to understand the causes of global
              expression variability. PEER extends previous related surrogate
              variable models and can be implemented within hours on a desktop

abstract = {Summary. Multiple-hypothesis testing involves guarding against much more complicated errors than single-hypothesis testing. Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach—we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR method.},
